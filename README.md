# my-html-portfolio
This is my first HTML project that I have uploaded as part of the course on Full Stack Web Development. It contains a simple HTML portfolio that is made up of basic HTML tags. If you are starting at the basics similar to me, then I encourage you to also be consistent in your learning of full stack and enjoy!!!
